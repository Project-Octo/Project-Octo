# Project Octo

## What we aim to build:

We aim to develop an innovative underwater ecosystem monitoring platform enabling divers to effortlessly identify and log diverse fish species while fostering data-sharing collaborations with marine conservation organizations for a comprehensive understanding and preservation of underwater biodiversity.



## Key Functionalities

**Key Functionalities for Divers:**

1. **Automatic Fish Identification:**
    - Utilize Google's machine learning and image recognition technologies to automatically identify various fish species based on images captured by divers.
2. **Logbook with Image Recognition:**
    - Enable divers to create detailed dive logs, including identified fish species, through image recognition technology, providing a visual record of their underwater experiences.

**Key Functionalities for Marine Conservation Organizations:**

1. **Data-Sharing Platform:**
    - Establish a secure platform for divers to voluntarily share their identified fish data with marine conservation organizations, facilitating research and conservation efforts.
2. **Real-time Data Analytics:**
    - Enable marine conservation organizations to access real-time analytics and reports on identified fish species, aiding in the monitoring and assessment of underwater biodiversity.
3. **Customized Data Filters:**
    - Implement customizable filters for organizations to sort and analyze data based on specific criteria, enhancing the efficiency of extracting valuable insights.
4. **Notification System:**
    - Set up a notification system to alert organizations about significant or rare underwater observations, allowing for timely responses to emerging conservation needs.

These key functionalities aim to cater to the needs of both divers and marine conservation organizations, fostering collaboration, data-sharing, and contributing to the broader goal of preserving underwater ecosystems.

The proposed app directly contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, "Life Below Water," which aims to conserve and sustainably use oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. Here's how the app addresses this specific SDG:

1. **Marine Biodiversity Conservation:**
    - The app empowers divers to contribute to the conservation of marine biodiversity by providing a user-friendly platform for the identification and documentation of various fish species. This data, when shared with marine conservation organizations, becomes a valuable resource for understanding and preserving underwater ecosystems.
2. **Scientific Research and Data Collection:**
    - By integrating Google's machine learning and image recognition technologies, the app facilitates the systematic collection of data on identified fish species. This data can be utilized by marine researchers and conservationists to enhance their understanding of marine life, ecosystem dynamics, and potential threats.
3. **Promoting Sustainable Diving Practices:**
    - The educational resources within the app educate divers about responsible diving practices, emphasizing the importance of sustainable interactions with marine environments. This contributes to reducing the impact of recreational diving on marine ecosystems.
4. **Community Engagement for Conservation:**
    - The app fosters a community of divers who share their experiences, insights, and observations. This collaborative platform promotes a sense of responsibility and shared commitment to marine conservation among the diving community.
5. **Enhancing Monitoring and Reporting:**
    - The Google Maps integration allows for precise location tracking of underwater observations. This feature enhances the accuracy of data and contributes to effective monitoring of marine areas, aiding in the identification of critical conservation areas and potential threats.
6. **Data-driven Conservation Initiatives:**
    - Marine conservation organizations can utilize the shared data for evidence-based decision-making and the development of targeted conservation initiatives. This contributes to the sustainable management of marine resources and habitats.
